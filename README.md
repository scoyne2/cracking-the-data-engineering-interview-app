## Codespaces
If you are running this in codespaces you can skip the below homebrew install. Create [codespace secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces) for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. You will still need to complete the `Env Setup` steps.
